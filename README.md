Introduction

This project implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm using C++ and OpenGL for graphical visualization. It showcases how BFS traverses a graph, exploring all its nodes and edges. The visualization provides an interactive way to understand the BFS algorithm through real-time rendering of graph structures and traversal steps.

Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

C++ compiler (such as GCC)
OpenGL and GLUT libraries
Basic knowledge of C++ programming and data structures
Basic understanding of BFS algorithm
